    "### What is Prompt Engineering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing prompts to get the most effective responses from language models. It's particularly crucial in financial applications where accuracy, consistency, and compliance are paramount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principles:\n",
    "1. **Clarity**: Be specific and unambiguous\n",
    "2. **Context**: Provide relevant background information\n",
    "3. **Structure**: Use consistent formatting and organization\n",
    "4. **Examples**: Include few-shot examples when needed\n",
    "5. **Constraints**: Define boundaries and limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangChain ChatPromptTemplate?\n",
    "- **Reusability**: Create template patterns for common tasks\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Separate prompt logic from application code\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple message types and dynamic content\n",
    "- **Integration**: Seamless integration with LangChain ecosystem"
