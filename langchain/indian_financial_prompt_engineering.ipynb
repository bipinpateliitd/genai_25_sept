    "## Summary and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Key Takeaways for Indian Financial Prompt Engineering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Context is King**\n",
    "- Always include Indian regulatory context (RBI, SEBI, IRDAI)\n",
    "- Consider local market conditions and cultural factors\n",
    "- Use appropriate Indian financial terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Prompt Engineering Techniques Ranking for Indian Finance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tree of Thoughts** - Best for complex decisions (investment, loans)\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought** - Excellent for calculations and step-by-step analysis\n",
    "3. **Few-Shot** - Perfect for classification and document processing\n",
    "4. **Role-Based** - Essential for specialized advice (rural banking, HNI services)\n",
    "5. **Zero-Shot** - Good for simple, well-defined tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Indian Financial Domain Specifics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ Always Include:**\n",
    "- Tax implications (current Indian tax slabs)\n",
    "- Inflation adjustment for long-term planning\n",
    "- Regulatory compliance requirements\n",
    "- Cultural sensitivity (joint families, festival expenses)\n",
    "- Regional variations (state-specific policies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**❌ Common Pitfalls:**\n",
    "- Using outdated tax rates or policies\n",
    "- Ignoring Indian market volatility patterns\n",
    "- Not considering monsoon impact on agricultural loans\n",
    "- Overlooking state-specific regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Security & Compliance:**\n",
    "- Never store or log sensitive financial data\n",
    "- Always include appropriate disclaimers\n",
    "- Follow RBI data localization guidelines\n",
    "- Implement proper data masking for PII\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Performance Optimization:**\n",
    "- Use template caching for frequently used prompts\n",
    "- Implement validation layers for critical calculations\n",
    "- Monitor accuracy with domain expert reviews\n",
    "- Regular updates for changing regulations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement A/B Testing** - Compare prompt variations for your use cases\n",
    "2. **Build Domain Knowledge Base** - Create Indian financial fact database\n",
    "3. **User Feedback Loop** - Collect and analyze user satisfaction\n",
    "4. **Regulatory Updates** - Set up alerts for policy changes\n",
    "5. **Multi-language Expansion** - Scale to more Indian languages\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 **Resources for Continued Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RBI Guidelines**: [www.rbi.org.in](https://www.rbi.org.in)\n",
    "- **Tax Laws**: Income Tax Department notifications\n",
    "- **Market Data**: NSE, BSE official sources\n",
    "- **Rural Finance**: NABARD guidelines and schemes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: Indian financial services require a unique blend of technical expertise, regulatory knowledge, and cultural sensitivity. The Tree of Thoughts methodology is particularly powerful for complex financial decision-making scenarios common in Indian households and businesses.\n",
