      "1. **Company Fundamentals**: Tata Motors, as a major automotive manufacturer, has a diverse portfolio including passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and electric vehicles. The current P/E ratio of 25 suggests the stock may be priced somewhat in line with industry averages, but it's important to analyze recent earnings, growth prospects, and any upcoming catalysts.\n",

      "3. **Valuation & Risk**: With a moderate risk appetite, consider how Tata Motors fits within your broader portfolio. Diversification across sectors and asset classes can help manage risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Research & Due Diligence**: Review recent financial reports, news, and analyst opinions. Look for factors such as profitability, debt levels, management strategy, and competitive positioning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Investment Strategy**: You might consider allocating a portion of your ₹500,000 investment to Tata Motors rather than the entire amount, to maintain diversification and manage risk effectively.\n",

      "**Summary**: Tata Motors could be a reasonable addition to your portfolio, but it’s important to perform thorough due diligence and consider how it complements your overall investment strategy. Consulting with a financial advisor tailored to your specific circumstances can also provide personalized guidance.\n",
